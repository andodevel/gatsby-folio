I became a full-time developer in 2012. I have spent the majority of my career focused on Java, moving from the role of Java Backend Developer to Java Full-Stack Developer. I have recently also expanded my technology stack into learning Golang, Python, ReactJS, Microservices and AI whilst continuing to build Java Enterprise applications.
